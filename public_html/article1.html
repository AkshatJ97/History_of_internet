                A code smell is a surface indication that usually corresponds to a deeper problem in the system.
                Kent Beck first coined the term. <br>It became popular after its appearance in Martin Fowler book,
                Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code.<br>
                Code smells are subjective and vary based on developer, language, and methodology, among other factors.
                It is an essential part of software development to find code smells, dig into the underlying causes and fix them via refactoring.
                <br><br>
                What are some frequently seen smells?
                <br><br>
                Bloaters: This includes code, like methods and classes, that has become huge over time by accumulating functionality and feature creep.<br>
                E.g., long methods, god-classes, long parameter lists.
                <br><br>
                Dispensable: This refers to dead code, which is not being invoked or executed. These blocks of code are unnecessary, as they provide no benefits but increase technical debt.
                E.g., duplicated code, refactoring artifacts, premature generalization.
                <br><br>
                Couplings: This means a code that should be independent ends up tied together because of excessive delegation or lack/absence of
                access <br>control.
                E.g., code forwarding, use of internal or private members.

                When it comes to what is code refactoring, it is the process used by a development team
                to clean up previously written code without changing that code functionality.
                It is not the process of rewriting code or fixing bugs or improving on observable software aspects, such as the interface.
                <br><br>
                So, what is code refactoring? <br><br>In its most basic form, code refactoring
                makes code more efficient and maintainable. As Ron Jeffries, one of the founders of
                Extreme Programming software methodology says, refactoring is like clearing a field: Instead of working around the weeds,
                you clear a path through them.
                <br>
                This has many potential advantages. Dirty code usually results from a developer’s inexperience,
                shortcuts taken to meet increasingly tight deadlines, poor management of the project,
                several different developers working on a project over time, or some combination of all of the above.
                Code refactoring helps to change this dirty code into clean code. With cleaner code,
                code readability improves, helping the QA and debugging processes to run that much more smoothly,
                while also improving the maintainability of the source code, in addition to the code’s overall
                structure and functionality. Code refactoring also helps to make it easier to expand upon the code and
                add new features in the future. Also, by removing any code duplication or other unnecessary parts,
                your code will use less memory and perform faster.

                Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable parts of an application,
                called units, are individually and independently scrutinized for proper operation.
                Even though manual unit testing is not unheard of, it is often preferred to have automated unit tests.
                In simpler words, unit tests help you find bugs in software and make sure the same bugs don’t cause the application to break again.
                <br><br>For one, tests will help you avoid delivering sub-standard code.
                A comprehensive test suite is extremely useful when adding a new feature to ensure that any modifications that you made
                don't break the existing code base. Further, when refactoring or removing redundant code, tests would be there
                to ensure that no corner cases are being violated by your changes. Keeping code clean is incredibly important, especially for vast open source projects.
                <br><br>Secondly, tests help increase code stability. If each commit is tested before deploying, it would ensure that the release version is <br>always a stable
                build and no users are being impacted by buggy developmental code. Not just this, tests also supplement your development code by helping
                new contributors get familiar with the possible tests cases they should keep in mind while making any changes.

                Pylint:
                Pylint is a source-code, bug and quality checker for the Python programming language.
                It is named following a common convention in Python of a "py" prefix, and a nod to the C programming lint program.
                It follows the style recommended by PEP 8, the Python style guide. It is similar to Pychecker and Pyflakes, but includes the following features:
                Checking the length of each line
                Checking that variable names are well-formed according to the project's coding standard
                Checking that declared interfaces are truly implemented.<br>
                Sharing code is a rewarding endeavor. Putting your code out there
                can be either an act of philanthropy, coming of age, or a basic
                extension of belief in open source. Whatever the motivation, your good
                intentions may not have the desired outcome if people<br> find your code hard
                to use or understand. The Python community has formalized some recommended
                programming styles to help everyone write code in a common, agreed-upon style
                that makes the most sense for shared code. This style is captured in PEP 8,
                the "Style Guide for Python Code". Pylint can be a quick and easy way of
                seeing if your code has captured the essence of PEP 8 and is therefore
                friendly to other potential users.
