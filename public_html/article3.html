                Polymorphism is the ability of an object to take on many forms. The most common use of polymorphism in
                OOP occurs when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.
                Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.<br>
                In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for their
                own type and for the class Object.
                It is important to know that the only possible way to access an object is through a reference variable.
                A reference variable can be of only one type. Once declared, the type of a reference variable cannot be changed.
                The reference variable can be reassigned to other objects provided that it is not declared final.
                The type of the reference variable would determine the methods that it can invoke on the object.
                A reference variable can refer to any object of its declared type or any subtype of its declared type.
                A reference variable can be declared as a class or interface type.<br>
                Now, the Deer class is considered to be polymorphic since this has multiple inheritance. Following are true for the above examples:<br>
                A Deer IS-A Animal<br>
                A Deer IS-A Vegetarian<br>
                A Deer IS-A Deer<br>
                A Deer IS-A Object<br>
                When we apply the reference variable facts to a Deer object reference, the following declarations are legal âˆ’<br>
                Example:<br>
                Deer d = new Deer();<br>
                Animal a = d;<br>
                Vegetarian v = d;<br>
                Object o = d;<br>
                All the reference variables d, a, v, o refer to the same Deer object in the heap.

                In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the mechanism of basing an object or class upon
                another object (prototype-based inheritance) or class (class-based inheritance),
                retaining a similar implementation. Also defined as deriving new classes (sub classes)
                from existing ones such as super class or base class and then forming them into a hierarchy of classes.
                <br><br>
                In most class-based object-oriented languages, an object created through inheritance, a "child object",
                acquires all the properties and behaviors of the "parent object" , with the exception of: constructors,
                destructors, overloaded operators and friend functions of<br> the base class. Inheritance allows programmers
                to create classes that are built upon existing classes,to specify a new implementation while
                maintaining the same behaviors (realizing an interface), to reuse code and to independently extend
                original software via public classes and interfaces. The relationships of objects or classes through
                inheritance give rise to a directed acyclic graph.
            <br><br>
            Why do we use inheritance?<br>
                Inheritance is very essential for expandability.<br>
                Inheritance is used to declare characteristics of classes inheriting it,without giving its implementation.
                After creating one super class<br> you can use its features to create several sub classes
                that inherits some features from its parent class and have few additional features.
                Inheritance enables code reusability and saves time.

                Encapsulation is one of the fundamentals of OOP (object-oriented programming).
                It refers to the bundling of data with the <br>methods that operate on that data.
                Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class,
                preventing unauthorized parties direct access to them.<br> Publicly accessible methods are generally
                provided in the class (so-called getters and setters) to access the values, and other client classes
                call these methods to retrieve and modify the values within the object.<br><br>
                Encapsulation is a good idea for several reasons:<br>

                The functionality is defined in one place and not in multiple places.<br>
                It is defined in a logical place i.e the place where the data is kept.<br>
                Data inside our object is not modified unexpectedly by external code in a completely different part of our program.<br>
                When we use a method, we only need to know what result the method will produce we do not need to know
                details about the object internals in order to use it. We could switch to using another object which
                is completely different on the inside, and not have to change any code because both objects have the same interface.

                Abstraction is the concept of object-oriented programming that shows only essential attributes
                and hides unnecessary<br> information. <br>
                The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details
                from the users. Abstraction is selecting data from a larger pool to show only relevant details of the
                object to the user. It helps in reducing programming complexity and efforts. It is one of the most
                important concepts of OOPs.<br>
                For example, people do not think of a car as a set of thousands of individual parts .
                Instead they see it as a well-defined object with its own unique behavior.
                This abstraction allows people to use a car to drive without knowing the
                complexity of the parts that form the car. They can ignore the details of how the
                engine transmission, and braking systems work. Instead, they are free to utilize the object as a whole.
                <br>
                A powerful way to manage abstraction is through the use of hierarchical
                classification. This allows us to layer the semantics of complex systems,
                breaking them into more manageable pieces. From the outside, a car is a single object.
                Once inside, you see that the car consists of several subsystems: steering, brakes,
                sound system, seat belts, etc. In turn, each of these subsystems is made up of <br>smaller units.
                <br>
                The point is that we manage the complexity of the car (or any other complex system) through
                the use of hierarchical abstractions.
