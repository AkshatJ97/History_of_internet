                These five software development principles are guidelines to follow when
                building software so that it is easier to scale and maintain. They were made popular
                by a software engineer, Robert C. Martin a.k.a Uncle Bob.SOLID is an acronym for the first five
                object-oriented design (OOD) principles.<br><br>
                S: SINGLE-RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE<br>
                    A class should have a single responsibility.<br>If a Class has many responsibilities,
            it increases the possibility of bugs because making changes to one of its responsibilities,<br>
            could affect the other ones without you knowing.<br>
            Goal<br>
            This principle aims to separate behaviours so that if bugs arise as a result of your change,
                it will not affect other unrelated behaviours.

                O: Open-Closed<br><br>
                Classes should be open for extension, but closed for modification<br>
                Changing the current behaviour of a Class will affect all the systems using that Class.
                If you want the Class to perform more<br> functions, the ideal approach is to add to the functions that
                already exist NOT change them.
                Goal
                This principle aims<br> to extend a Class behaviour without changing the existing behaviour of that Class.
                This is to avoid causing bugs wherever<br> the Class is being used.<br>

                During the 1990s, the open closed principle became popularly redefined to refer to the use of abstracted
                interfaces, where the implementations can be changed and multiple implementations could be created and
                polymorphically substituted for each other.
                <br>
                In contrast to Meyer's usage, this definition advocates inheritance from abstract base classes.
                Interface specifications can be reused through inheritance but implementation need not be. The existing
                interface is closed to modifications and new implementations <br>must, at a minimum, implement that
                interface.
                <br>
                Robert C. Martin's 1996 article "The Open-Closed Principle" was one of the seminal writings to take
                this approach. In 2001, Craig Larman related the open–closed principle to the pattern by Alistair
                Cockburn called Protected Variations, and to the David Parnas discussion of information hiding.

                L:  Liskov Substitution<br><br>
                If S is a subtype of T, then objects of type T in a program may be replaced with objects of type S
                without altering any of the desirable properties of that program.<br>
                When a child Class cannot perform the same actions as its parent Class, this can cause bugs.
                If you have a Class and create another Class from it, it becomes a parent<br> and the new Class becomes a
                child. The child Class should be able to do everything the parent Class can do. This process is called
                Inheritance.<br>
                The child Class should be able to process the same requests and deliver the same result as the
                parent Class or it could deliver a<br> result that is of the same type.
                The picture shows that the parent Class delivers Coffee(it could be any type of coffee). It is
                acceptable<br> for the child Class to deliver Cappucino because it is a specific type of Coffee, but it is
                NOT acceptable to deliver Water.<br>
                If the child Class doesn’t meet these requirements, it means the child Class is changed completely and
                violates this principle.<br>
                Goal<br>
                This principle aims to enforce consistency so that the parent Class or its child Class can be used in
                the same way without any errors.

                I : Interface Segregation<br><br>
                Clients should not be forced to depend on methods that they do not use.<br>
                When a Class is required to perform actions that are not useful, it is wasteful and may produce
                unexpected bugs if the Class does not have the ability to perform those actions.<br>
                A Class should perform only actions that are needed to fulfil its role. Any other action should be
                removed completely or moved somewhere else if it might be used by another Class in the future.
                Goal
                This principle aims at splitting a set of actions into smaller sets so that a Class executes ONLY the
                set of actions it requires.<br>
                The ISP was first used and formulated by Robert C. Martin while consulting for Xerox.
                Xerox had created a new printer system that could perform a variety of tasks such as stapling and faxing.
                The software for this system was created from the ground up. As the software grew, making modifications
                became more and more difficult so that even the smallest change would take a redeployment <br>cycle of an
                hour, which made development nearly impossible.
                <br><br>
                The design problem was that a single Job class was used by almost all of the tasks.
                Whenever a print job or a stapling job needed <br>to be performed, a call was made to the Job class.
                This resulted in a 'fat' class with multitudes of methods specific to a variety of different clients.
                Because of this design, a staple job would know about all the methods of the print job, even though
                there was no use for them.

                D: Dependency Inversion
                <br>
                High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on the abstraction.
                <br> Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.<br>
                Firstly, let’s define the terms used here more simply<br>
                High-level Module(or Class): Class that executes an action with a tool.<br>
                Low-level Module (or Class): The tool that is needed to execute the action<br>
                Abstraction: Represents an interface that connects the two Classes.
                Details: How the tool works
                This principle says a Class should not <br>be fused with the tool it uses to execute an action. Rather, it
                should be fused to the interface that will allow the tool to connect to the Class.
                It also says that both the Class and the interface should not know how the tool works. However,
                the tool needs to meet the specification of the interface.
                Goal
                This principle aims at reducing the dependency of a high-level Class on the low-level Class by introducing an interface.
