                A test is a procedure that exercises a behavior to determine if the behavior functions correctly.
                There are several kinds of tests, like unit tests, integration tests, or end-to-end tests,
                but all functional tests do the same basic thing: they try something and report PASS or FAIL.
                <br>
                Testing provides an empirical feedback loop for development. That is how testing keeps us safe.
                With tests, we know when things break.  <br> Without tests, coding can be dangerous. We do not want to deploy
                big old bugs!<br>

                So, if we intend to spend time writing tests, how can we write good tests? There is a simple but
                powerful pattern to follow: <b>Arrange-Act-Assert.</b>
                <br>
                The Pattern
                Arrange-Act-Assert is a great way to structure test cases. It prescribes an order of operations:
                <br>
                Arrange inputs and targets. Arrange steps should set up the test case. Does the test require any objects
                or special settings? Does it need to prep a database? Does it need to log into a web app? Handle all of
                these operations at the start of the test.<br>
                Act on the target behavior. Act steps should cover the main thing to be tested. This could be calling a
                function or method, calling a REST API, or interacting with a web page. Keep actions focused on the
                target behavior.<br>
                Assert expected outcomes. Act steps should elicit some sort of response. Assert steps verify the
                goodness or badness of that response.<br> Sometimes, assertions are as simple as checking numeric or string
                values.<br>
                Other times, they may require checking multiple facets of a system. Assertions will ultimately determine
                if the test passes or fails.<br>
                Behavior-Driven Development follows the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern by another name: Given-When-Then.
                The Gherkin language uses Given-When-Then steps to specify behaviors in scenarios. Given-When-Then is
                essentially the same formula as Arrange-Act-Assert.<br>

                Every major programming language has at least one test framework. Frameworks like JUnit, NUnit,
                Cucumber, and (my favorite) pytest enable <br>you,as the programmer, to automate tests, execute suites,
                and report results.

                Software testing is important because if there are any bugs or errors in the software, they can be
                identified early and fixed before the software product is delivered. A properly tested software product
                ensures dependability, security, and high performance, which leads to time savings, cost effectiveness,
                and customer satisfaction.

                It happens to be an integral part of the process. However, it involves a <br>huge cut off from the pocket.

                Nevertheless, you need to keep in mind that the price owing to the failure of the software can
                be really high.

                Here are the top reasons why the testing of the software is really important:<br><br>

                1. Helps in saving money<br>
                The testing of software has a wide array of benefits. The cost-effectiveness of the project happens
                to be one of the top reasons why companies go for software testing Services.
                <br>
                The testing of software comprises a bunch of projects. In case you find any bug in the early phases,
                fixing them costs a reduced<br> amount of money.
                Hence, it is a prerequisite that you should get the testing done in no time. As you hire quality
                analysts or testers who have an ample amount of experience and have gone through technical education
                for the projects, they are the investments and the project is going to reap the benefits.
                <br><br>
                2. Security<br>
                It is another crucial point why software testing should not be taken into consideration.
                <br>
                It is considered to be the most vulnerable and sensitive part. There are a bunch of situations in
                which the information and details of the users are stolen and they are used for the benefits.
                <br>
                It is considered to be the reason why people look for the well tested and reliable products.
                <br>
                As a specific product undergoes testing, the user can be ensured that they are going to receive a
                reliable product. The personal <br>details of the user can be safe. Users can receive products that are
                free from vulnerability with the aid of software testing.<br>
                <br><br>
                3.Quality of the product<br>
                For ensuring that the specific product comes to life, it should work in accordance with the following.
                <br>
                Following the needs of the product is a prerequisite as it is helpful in getting the prerequisite results.
                <br>
                Products should be serving the user in one way or the other. It is a must that it is going to bring
                the value, as per the promise.<br>

                Hence, it should function in a complete manner for ensuring an effective customer experience. It is
                also necessary to check the compatibility of the device.<br>

                For instance, in case, you are planning to launch an application, it is a must to check the
                compatibility of the same in a wide array of operating systems and devices.<br>
                <br><br>
                4. Satisfaction of the customer<br>
                The primary objective of the owner of the products is offering the best satisfaction of the customers.
                <br>
                The reasons why it is necessary to opt for software testing is due to the fact that it offers the
                prerequisite and perfect user experience.<br>

                As you opt for the best project in the saturated project, you will be capable of earning the
                reputation of reliable clients.<br>

                Thus, you are going to reap long-term benefits by opting for software testing. Earning the trust of
                the client is certainly not an easy <br>task, primarily in case the product is found to be functioning
                and glitching every time or the other.<br>

                You yourself have used a lot of products and you surely had several horrible experiences owing to
                which you might have deleted the application.<br>

                The market is really saturated in the present days.<br>

                The first impression is really important and if you fail to give the same, users are going to find
                another product which will accomplish<br> all the requirements.<br>
                <br><br>
                5. Enhancing the development process<br>
                With the aid of Quality Assurance, you can find a wide array of scenarios and errors, for the
                reproduction of the error.<br>

                It is really simple and the developers need to fix the same in no time. In addition to this, software
                testers should be working with the development team parallelly, which is useful in the acceleration of
                the development procedure.<br>
                <br><br>
                6. Easy while adding new features<br>
                The more interconnected and older the code, the more difficult it is to change. Tests counteract this
                calcification tendency by allowing developers to confidently add new features. As a new developer,
                changing older parts of your codebase can be terrifying, but with<br> tests, you’ll at least know if you’ve
                broken anything important. This helps in making your software stand ahead in the market, and<br> beat the
                competition.<br>
                <br><br>
                7. Determining the performance of the software<br>
                If you find software or application that has low or reduced performance, you will find that it brings
                your reputation down in the market.<br>

                Users are not going to trust any people. There are chances that the reputation of your organization is
                going to suffer.<br>
                <br>
                In accordance with the experts, it is not that important. However, in case, you introduce any software
                in the market without software testing and after this, the performance of the software does not meet
                the expectation or requirements of the clients, convincing people will be a hassle.
                <br>
                Thus, software testing is considered to be an easy option as it helps in the determination of the
                performance of the software.
