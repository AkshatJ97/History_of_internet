            <p class="part13">In world war II,circuit swithcing was used as the mode of communication.
                The drawback of this technology:it was a centralized system. Enemies could explode
                the central system and there would be no point of communication.So, leaders thought
                they needed another technology to avoid this.
                Therefore,<b>President Dwight D Eisenhower</b> started an organisation called ARPA(Advanced Research Project Agency).
                Objective of this organisation: To facilitate research in technology with potential military applications.
                ARPA gave their military requirements to private companies and universities to do the research on
                their behalf in exchange for money or funds.
                On February 7,1958 ARPA was renamed to <b>DARPA(Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency)</b>.
                DARPA's first project was ARPANET(Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), which was the forerunner
                of the Internet in 1966.This project was initiated with <b>J.C.R Licklider</b> along with <b>Bob Taylor</b>.
                They founded TCP/IP protocol to overcome circuit switching drawback.
                DARPAâ€™s first project ARPANET came to fruition in 1969 with packet switching(a distributed network).
                Along with J.C.R Licklider,Bob Taylor was also a part of the research which was
                the foundation of today's internet.Later he founded XEROX PARC as well.At that time XEROX PARC was doing its
                own research as well. They built the first computer with GUI(Graphical user interface).They
                also invented laser printers and were responsible for making email which is used extensively to this date.

            <p class="part16">Altair 8800 was the first personal computer made.
                For 8 bits there were 8 switches which were used to type a message and that message would be
                showed on a monitor.In 1976,Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs sold Apple II as their first commercial computer.
                In this computer keyboard was installed along with the display unlike Altair 8800.
                Apple II was a success and was disrupting IBM market share.IBM used to sell mainframe computers.
                They wanted to make BIOS as well.Therefore,IBM went to Gary Kildall who made
                CPM(Control Program for microcomputers)
                operating system.However,the deal did not happen.IBM then went to Microsoft and Bill Gates
                provided them with the BIOS similar to that of Gary Kildall with minor changes. Bill licensed that product.
                <br>
                On <b>August 6,1991,Al Gore,vice-president of the United States</b> made ARPANET public.
                Internet was used by the military and organisation for research and development till that date.
                However, once it was made public people could use it to communicate to each other throughout the United States.
                <br>
                <b>In 1989,Tim Berners-Lee</b>, a British scientist,invented HTTP protocol and HTML for the publicly available internet.
                Before the advent of http protocol people could only send files and emails via the Internet but
                could not type in an address and view the web page present in that server.However, with the advent of the
                http protocol this was possible.
